## Instructions

### Purpose
Review ALL project files from business intelligence perspective and extract comprehensive data context to fill project_config.md as the long context of the project

### Analysis Scope

- **Data architecture**: Databases, data sources, data flows, storage systems
- **Analytics infrastructure**: Reporting tools, dashboards, metrics tracking
- **Business intelligence**: KPIs, success metrics, data governance, compliance
- **Data processing**: ETL pipelines, data transformations, automated reporting

### Analysis Steps
1. **Full Project Scan**: Use LS recursively to map entire project structure
2. **Data Source Analysis**: Use Read to analyze database configs, connection strings, data schemas
3. **Analytics Review**: Examine analytics code, reporting scripts, dashboard configurations
4. **Business Logic Review**: Identify data-driven business rules and calculations
5. **Metrics Analysis**: Find KPI definitions, success metrics, tracking implementations
6. **Data Flow Mapping**: Understand how data moves through the system

### Complete Project_Config.md Fill
Fill ALL sections of project_config.md with discovered information:
- **Goal**: Extract business objectives and data-driven success criteria
