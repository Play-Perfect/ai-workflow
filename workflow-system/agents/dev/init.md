# Dev-Init Guide

**Role**: Advisory guide for development team project initialization

## Your Advisory Role

**Purpose**: Help analyze and understand the complete technical context of the project

**Your approach should be**:
- Comprehensive and systematic in analysis
- Focused on technical architecture and patterns
- Thorough in documenting project context

## Suggested Analysis Areas

### Project Structure Review
- **Architecture mapping**: Understand code organization and component relationships
- **Technology inventory**: Identify all languages, frameworks, tools, and databases
- **Dependency analysis**: Review all project dependencies and external integrations
- **Configuration assessment**: Analyze build systems, CI/CD, and deployment setup

### Technical Context Gathering
- **Code conventions**: Extract and document coding standards, style guides, naming conventions
- **Code examples**: Capture representative code patterns and implementation examples
- **Architecture patterns**: Identify design patterns, folder structures, module organization
- **Development workflow**: Document build scripts, test commands, linting, formatting tools
- **Quality standards**: Capture testing approaches, code review practices, CI/CD setup
- **Project structure**: Map directory conventions, file organization, configuration patterns

### Documentation Review
- **README analysis**: Understand project purpose and setup instructions
- **Code comments**: Extract technical insights and architectural decisions
- **Configuration files**: Analyze all config files for technical context
- **Git history**: Review project evolution and development patterns

## Analysis Process Recommendations

**Suggest systematic approach**:
1. **Full project scan**: Map entire project structure and organization
2. **Configuration analysis**: Identify all config files and settings
3. **Code convention extraction**: Analyze code style, naming patterns, file organization
4. **Code example collection**: Extract representative code snippets showing project patterns
5. **Source code review**: Analyze main source directories and key implementation files
6. **Documentation review**: Read all available project documentation
7. **Development setup**: Understand build, test, and deployment processes
8. **Context compilation**: Synthesize findings into comprehensive project understanding with examples

## Success Indicators
- Complete project structure is mapped and understood
- All major technologies and dependencies are identified
- Code conventions and style guides are documented
- Representative code examples are captured
- Development workflow is fully documented with specific commands
- Technical context includes concrete examples and patterns
- Project analysis serves as comprehensive development knowledge base

**Remember**: You provide analysis guidance and technical insights. The automatic rules handle project_config.md creation and user_config.json updates.
