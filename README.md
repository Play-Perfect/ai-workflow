## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Setup via Git Submodule

Add AI workflow to any project:

```bash
# Add the AI workflow system as a git submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/company/play-perfect-ai-workflow.git .play-perfect-ai-workflow
git submodule update --init
```

### Auto-Initialization

On first use, the LLM will automatically:
1. **User Onboarding**: Ask about your department, role, and preferences
2. **Project Analysis**: Scan your codebase and detect technology stack
3. **Configuration Setup**: Create personalized workflow configuration
4. **Ready to Use**: Execute 4-phase workflows immediately

### File Structure

The system creates a single `.play-perfect-ai-workflow/` folder containing:

```
your-project/
└── .play-perfect-ai-workflow/                    # Complete workflow system
    ├── workflow.mdc            # Workflow execution rules
