# AI Workflow System (Current Implementation)

A simple AI workflow system for managing development tasks through structured phases with state tracking and session management.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîÑ 4-Phase Workflow**: INIT ‚Üí ANALYZE ‚Üí BLUEPRINT ‚Üí CONSTRUCT ‚Üí VALIDATE
- **üìÅ Session Management**: Individual session tracking with timestamps and unique IDs
- **üìä State Tracking**: Persistent workflow state with automatic rule-based transitions
- **üõ†Ô∏è Project Configuration**: Customizable tech stack, patterns, and constraints
- **üìù Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive activity logs with automatic rotation
- **‚úÖ Validation & Testing**: Built-in test execution and quality assurance

## üöÄ Installation

The system uses a simple file-based approach:

1. Copy `workflow_state.md` and `project_config.md` to your project
2. Place them in a `context/` directory
3. Configure your project-specific settings in `project_config.md`
4. Start using the workflow by invoking the INIT phase

### File Structure

```
your-project/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project_config.md      # Project configuration and tech stack
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow_state.md      # Workflow rules and state management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .ai_workflow/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sessions/              # Session-specific workflow files

## üîÑ Detailed Workflow Description

### Phase-Based Execution Model

#### üîß Phase 1: INIT
**Purpose**: Session setup and initialization

**Actions:**
- Create new session-specific workflow state file in `.ai_workflow/sessions/`
- Generate unique session ID with timestamp and feature name
- Set initial phase to ANALYZE and status to RUNNING
- Prepare for task analysis

**File Creation**: `workflow_state_${timestamp}_${feature_name}.md`

#### üîç Phase 2: ANALYZE  
**Purpose**: Requirements gathering and context understanding

**Actions:**
- Read `project_config.md` to understand project-specific requirements
- Analyze existing patterns and tech stack constraints
- Summarize requirements without implementation planning
- Gather all necessary context for blueprint creation

**Output**: Requirements summary and context analysis

#### üìù Phase 3: BLUEPRINT
**Purpose**: Implementation planning and user approval

**Actions:**
- Decompose task into ordered, executable steps
- Write pseudocode or file-level diff outline
- Present plan to user for approval
- Set status to `NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL` and await confirmation
- Only proceed to CONSTRUCT after explicit user approval

**Output**: Detailed implementation plan under `## Plan` section

#### üî® Phase 4: CONSTRUCT
**Purpose**: Plan execution and implementation

**Actions:**
- Follow the approved plan exactly
- Execute each atomic change step-by-step
- Run test/linter commands after each change (specified in `project_config.md`)
- Log all tool output and results
- Automatic progression to VALIDATE on successful completion

**Quality Gates**: Tests and linting must pass at each step

#### üß™ Phase 5: VALIDATE
**Purpose**: Final validation and completion

**Actions:**
- Run full test suite and end-to-end checks
- Verify all quality requirements are met
- Set status to `COMPLETED` on success
- Update project changelog automatically
- Trigger iteration rules for additional tasks

**Output**: Quality validation results and changelog updates

```

### ü§ñ Automated Rules System

The workflow includes several automated rules for state management:

#### RULE_INIT_01
**Trigger**: `Phase == INIT`  
**Action**: Create new state file, ask for task, set Phase = ANALYZE

#### RULE_ITERATE_01
**Trigger**: `Status == COMPLETED && Items contains unprocessed rows`  
**Action**: Process next item, reset to ANALYZE phase

#### RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01
**Trigger**: `Log section > 5,000 characters`  
**Action**: Summarize top 5 findings, archive to ArchiveLog, clear Log

#### RULE_SUMMARY_01
**Trigger**: `Phase == VALIDATE && Status == COMPLETED`  
**Action**: Update project changelog with completed work summary

### üìä Session Tracking & Logging

**Session Files**: Each workflow creates a unique session file with:
- Timestamp-based naming: `workflow_state_20250127_143000_feature.md`
- State tracking: Phase, Status, CurrentItem, SessionId
- Implementation plan storage
- Detailed activity logging
- Archive log for summarized history

**Logging Features**:
- Automatic tool output capture
- Error tracking and debugging
- Log rotation to prevent file bloat
- Archive system for historical reference

### ‚öôÔ∏è Project Configuration

The `project_config.md` file allows customization of:

**Tech Stack Configuration**:
- Programming language and version
- Framework and tooling choices
- Build and test commands

**Development Patterns**:
- Code style guidelines
- File naming conventions
- Type safety requirements

**Performance Constraints**:
- Bundle size limits
- Performance benchmarks
- API rate limiting

**Quality Gates**:
- Test execution requirements
- Linting rules
- Code review standards

### üìà Current Implementation Status

This is the **current working implementation** of the AI workflow system, featuring:

- ‚úÖ **4-phase structured workflow**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic rule-based transitions**
- ‚úÖ **Session tracking and logging**
- ‚úÖ **Quality gate enforcement**
- ‚úÖ **Project-specific configuration**

The system is designed for simplicity and reliability, focusing on core workflow management without complex integrations.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Initialize**: Start with Phase INIT to create a new session
2. **Configure**: Ensure `project_config.md` reflects your project setup
3. **Execute**: Follow the 4-phase workflow for each development task
4. **Track**: Monitor progress through session files and logs
5. **Validate**: Rely on automated quality gates and testing

This system provides a solid foundation for AI-assisted development workflows with clear phase transitions, comprehensive logging, and quality assurance.
